# Note Metadata

Note metadata is a way to store information about a note.

This information is stored in a separate file. It is usually stored in IPFS, but it can be stored in an alternative way so long as the client can access it.

## Note Metadata File

The note metadata file is a JSON file. Here is an example:

```json
{
  "title": "Hello World",
  "content": "# Hello World\n\nThis is a markdown note.",
  "tags": ["article", "dairy"],
  "sources": ["xlog"],
  "external_urls": ["https://twitter.com/_Crossbell/status/1555900801058488322"],
  "date_published": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "attributes": [
    { "value": "post", "trait_type": "type" },
    { "value": "https://example.com", "trait_type": "URL" },
    { "value": 1546360800, "trait_type": "Birthday", "display_type": "date" }
  ],
}
```

## Note Metadata Schema

The note metadata schema is defined as follows:

```ts
export class NoteMetadataAttachmentBase<
  ContentType extends 'address' | 'content',
> {
  /**
   * The name of this attachment.
   */
  name?: string

  /**
   * The address (url) of this attachment.
   */
  address?: ContentType extends 'address' ? string : never

  /**
   * The plain content of this attachment.
   */
  content?: ContentType extends 'content' ? string : never

  /**
   * The mime type of the `content`.
   */
  mime_type?: string

  /**
   * The size of the `content` in bytes.
   */
  size_in_bytes?: number

  /**
   * The alternate text (description) of this attachment.
   * This is used for accessibility or is displayed when the source is not available.
   */

  /**
   * The width of this attachment, in pixels.
   */
  width?: number

  /**
   * The height of this attachment, in pixels.

   *
   * @example
   * 'nsfw'
   */
  content_warning?: 'nsfw' | 'sensitive' | 'spoiler'
