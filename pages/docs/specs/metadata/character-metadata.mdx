# Character Metadata

Character metadata is a way to store information about a character.

This information is stored in a separate file. It is usually stored in IPFS, but it can be stored in an alternative way so long as the client can access it.

## Character Metadata File

The character metadata file is a JSON file. Here is an example:

```json
{
  "name": "Character Name",
  "avatars": ["https://example.com/avatar.png"],
  "bio": "Character Bio",
  "websites": ["https://example.com"],
  "banners": [
    {
      "address": "https://example.com/banner.png",
      "mime_type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "connected_accounts": ["csb://account:someone@twitter"],
  "connected_avatars": ["csb://asset:0x5452c7fb99d99fab3cc1875e9da9829cb50f7a13-753@ethereum"],
  "attributes": [
    {
      "value": "Trait Value",
      "trait_type": "Trait Type",
      "display_type": "string",
    }
  ]
}
```

## Character Metadata Schema

The character metadata schema is defined as follows:

```ts
class CharacterMetadata {
  /** The name of this character. */
  name?: string

  /**
   * The avatars of this character.
   * The first avatar is the primary avatar.
   *
   * @example
   * ['ipfs://Qm...', 'ipfs://Qm...']
   */
  avatars?: string[]

  /** The bio of this character. */
  bio?: string

  /**
   * The websites of this character.
   *
   * @example
   * ['https://example.com', 'https://example.org']
   */
  websites?: string[]

  /**
   * The banners of this character.
   *
   * @example
   * [{ address: 'ipfs://Qm...', mime_type: 'image/png' }]
   */
  banners?: {
    /**
     * The address (url) of this banner.
     */
    address: string

    /**
     * The mime type of this banner file.
     */
    mime_type: string
  }[]

  /**
   * The social links of this character. It should follow the csb:// scheme.
   *
   * The format is `csb://account:<identity>@<platform>`.
   *
   * @example
   * ['csb://account:someone@twitter', 'csb://account:someone@github']
   */
  connected_accounts?: string[]

  /**
   * The special connected avatars of this character. it should follow the csb:// scheme.
   *
   * Use case: use an NFT as avatar.
   *
   * The format is `csb://asset:<contract_address>-<token_id>@<network>`.
   *
   * @example
   * ['csb://asset:0x5452c7fb99d99fab3cc1875e9da9829cb50f7a13-753@ethereum']
   */
  connected_avatars?: string[]

  /**
   * Custom attributes.
   *
   * @example
   * [{ value: "post", trait_type: "type" }, { value: "https://example.com", trait_type: "URL" }, { value: 1546360800, trait_type: 'Birthday', "display_type": "date" }]
   */
  attributes?: {
    value: string | number | boolean | null
    trait_type?: string
    display_type?: 'string' | 'number' | 'date' | 'boolean'
  }[]
}
```

### `name`

The display name.

It can be any string.

### `avatars`

The first avatar is the primary avatar. It is used as the default avatar.

The avatars should be a list of URLs (https or ipfs) pointing to images. The URLs should be accessible by the client.

```json

The banners should be a list of objects, each containing an `address` and a `mime_type`. The `address` should be a URL (https or ipfs) pointing to an image, and the `mime_type` should be the MIME type of the image file.

For example, the following is a valid list of banners:

```json

### `attributes`
