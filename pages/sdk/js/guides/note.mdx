# Note

A character can create notes.

A note is typically an article published on the blockchain.

## Create a Note

Assume that we have a character named `Alice` with character ID `42`. Alice wants create a note as a blog post:

```ts
contract.postNote(
  42, // character ID
  "https://example.com/note.json", // note metadata URL
);
```

### Note Metadata

The `https://example.com/note.json` above is the URL of the note metadata. The note is a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Hello World",
  "content": "This is a note."
}
```

It can be hosted on any web server. It can be `ipfs://` URL. For example, here is another more complex note metadata: [`ipfs://bafkreidhjuuo2vibtevn66v2q6bjq652sfox6csocg6v2adwhywifcnzcy`](https://ipfs.4everland.xyz/ipfs/bafkreidhjuuo2vibtevn66v2q6bjq652sfox6csocg6v2adwhywifcnzcy).

You can create a note with metadata content object directly:

```ts
contract.postNote(
  42, // character ID
  {
    title: "Hello World",
    content: "This is a note."
  }
);
```

In this case, the SDK will automatically upload the metadata to IPFS and create a `ipfs://` URL for you.

Please refer to [Note Metadata](/docs/specs/metadata/note-metadata) for more details.
