# Note

A character can create notes.

A note is typically an article published on the blockchain.

## Create a Note

Assume that we have a character named `Alice` with character ID `42`. Alice wants create a note as a blog post:

```ts
contract.postNote(
  42, // character ID
  "https://example.com/note.json", // note metadata URL
);
```

Please refer to [`postNote`](/sdk/js/contract/note/create-note#postnote) for more details.

### Note Metadata

The `https://example.com/note.json` above is the URL of the note metadata. The note is a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Hello World",
  "content": "This is a note."
}
```

It can be hosted on any web server. It can be `ipfs://` URL. For example, here is another more complex note metadata: [`ipfs://bafkreidhjuuo2vibtevn66v2q6bjq652sfox6csocg6v2adwhywifcnzcy`](https://ipfs.4everland.xyz/ipfs/bafkreidhjuuo2vibtevn66v2q6bjq652sfox6csocg6v2adwhywifcnzcy).

You can create a note with metadata content object directly:

```ts
contract.postNote(
  42, // character ID
  {
    title: "Hello World",
    content: "This is a note."
  }
);
```

In this case, the SDK will automatically upload the metadata to IPFS and create a `ipfs://` URL for you.

Please refer to [Note Metadata](/docs/specs/metadata/note-metadata) for more details.

### Note Link/Mint Module

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout>
  Before attaching a link or a module to a note, please refer to the [Concepts - Mint/Link Module](/docs/concepts/link-mint-module) section to learn more about what a module is.
</Callout>

// TODO @songkeys

Please refer to the [`linkModule` options API](/sdk/js/contract/note/create-note#optionslinkmodule-optional) and [`mintModule` options API](/sdk/js/contract/note/create-note#optionsmintmodule-optional) for more details.

### Mint a Note

After creating a note, everyone (wallets) can mint it.

For example, to mint a note with characterId `42` and noteId `5` to the address `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`:

```ts
const { data } = await contract.mintNote(
  42, // characterId
  5, // noteId
  '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', // toAddress
)
```

Now, the address `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890` owns the note NFT with contract address `0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1` and token ID `6` (meaning that the note NFT is stored at the contract of address `0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1`, and the minter is the 6th to mint).

This minted note NFT is of ERC721 type. It can be transferred to another address, or burned.

<Callout>
  It deserves to be noted that minting might fail if the note is attached with a mint module that limits who can mint it. The app should handle this case.

Please refer to [`mintNote`](/sdk/js/contract/note/mint-note#mintnote) for more details.

### Note Variant: "Achievement"

#### Publish an Achievement Note

A character can post a note as an achievement for others to mint.

This is done by setting the `"variant"` field in the [note metadata](/docs/specs/metadata/note-metadata) to `"achievement"`. For example:

```json {2}
{
  "variant": "achievement",
  "title": "Sponsor NFT",
  "content": "This is a sponsor NFT for my fans.",
  "attachements": [
    {
      "mint_type": "image/png",
      "address": "ipfs://example/sponsor_nft.png"
    }
  ],
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Tier",
      "value": "Gold",
      "display_type": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

```ts
contract.postNote(
  42, // character ID
  "https://example.com/my-sponsor-nft.json", // note metadata URL
);
```

This note is not technically special; it just has a `"variant"` field to indicate that it is an achievement NFT, and should be **displayed** as such in Apps.

#### Query Achievement Notes

You can query the note from the indexer with the `variant` field to get the list of achievement notes:

```ts
const { list } = await indexer.getNotes({
  characterId: 42,
  variant: "achievement",
});
```

#### Attach Mint Module

Just as other notes, an achievement note can be attached with a mint module.

One useful example is to limit the group of people who can mint the achievement note. In this case, `ApproveMintModule` can be used.

```ts
contract.postNote(
  42, // character ID
  "https://example.com/my-sponsor-nft.json", // note metadata URL
  {
    mintModule: {
      address: "0x8d040b35cEad83782c62845BEbE026504B73b509",
      data: [
        ['0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', '0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1'],
        1,
      ]
    },
  }
);
```

The above code will attach a `ApproveMintModule` to the achievement note, which means that only these two addresses can mint the achievement note, and each address can mint it only once (`1`).
