# Create Character

A character is a distinct identity that enables interaction with the blockchain. In other words, it is the account that represents a user on the blockchain.

One user has one single crypto wallet. Each wallet (also referred to as an address) can contain multiple characters. Every character is associated with a single wallet.

You can learn more about characters in the [Concept - Character](/docs/concepts/character) section.

## `createCharacter`

This creates a new character for an address and returns the ID of the newly created character. When it is the first character created for an address, the address is automatically set as the primary character.

```ts
createCharacter(owner: string, handle: string, metadataOrUri: string | CharacterMetadata, overrides?: Overrides): Promise<Result<number, true>>
```

### Usage

```ts
const result = await contract.createCharacter(
  '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
  'Jason',
  'ipfs://xxxx/metadata.json',
)
```

or:

```ts
const result = await contract.createCharacter(
  '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
  'Jason',
  { name: 'Jason', bio: 'I am Jason' },
)
```

### Parameters

#### `owner`

- Type: string

The Ethereum address of the character owner.

#### `handle`

- Type: string

The handle of the character.

It must be unique among all characters.

It follows this regular expression: `^[a-z0-9\-\_]{3,32}$`, which means it can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, and must be between 3 and 32 characters long.

#### `metadataOrUri`

- Type: string | [CharacterMetadata](https://crossbell-box.github.io/crossbell.js/classes/CharacterMetadata.html)

The metadata of the character. It can be either an URL string or a [CharacterMetadata](https://crossbell-box.github.io/crossbell.js/classes/CharacterMetadata.html) object.

See more about character metadata in the [Spec - Character Metadata](/docs/specs/metadata/character-metadata) section.

### Returns

```ts
interface Returns {
  data: number // characterId
  transactionHash: string
}
```
