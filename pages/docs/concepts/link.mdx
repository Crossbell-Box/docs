# Link (Interaction)

As we have mentioned, we use links to describe different interactions in social activities. Each link has a link type, which can be an arbitrary string defined by the user. Link is emitted from either a character or a note, and points to an object, which can be an Ethereum address, character, note, ERC721 asset on Crossbell, any URI, or a Linklist instance.

Linklist is the group of all linking objects with the **same link type** and emitted from a **character** which natively is an **NFT**, Each time a character makes a link with a new type, correspondingly a new linklist will be created and attached to that character by default.
