A note can be deleted by the owner.

## `deleteNote`

deleteNote(characterId: BigNumberish, noteId: BigNumberish, overrides?: Overrides): Promise<Result<undefined, true>>
```

### Usage

contract.deleteNote(
  42, // characterId
  5, // noteId
)
```

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="warning">
  <p>This only changes the note's `deleted` property to `true`. It can't really be deleted from the blockchain.</p>
  <p>In fact, it is not possible to delete a note from the blockchain; the only feasible option is to "hide" it in a contract as so, based on the convention.</p>
</Callout>

- Type: BigNumberish

The ID of the character.

#### `noteId`

- Type: BigNumberish

The ID of the note.
