## Get Feed

### Get Feed of a Character

For example, we want to get the feed of character `42`:

```ts
const { list } = indexer.getFeedsOfCharacter(42)
```

You can filter the feed by type:

```ts
import { FeedType } from 'crossbell.js'

const { list } = indexer.getFeedsOfCharacter(42, {
  type: [FeedType.CREATE_CHARACTER, FeedType.UPDATE_CHARACTER_HANDLE],
})
```

Note that if you want to get the feed of posting notes, you have to specify all the `POST_NOTE*` types:

```ts
import { FeedType } from 'crossbell.js'

const { list } = indexer.getFeedsOfCharacter(42, {
  type: [
    FeedType.POST_NOTE,
    FeedType.POST_NOTE_FOR_NOTE,
    FeedType.POST_NOTE_FOR_ANY_URI,
    FeedType.POST_NOTE_FOR_ADDRESS,
    FeedType.POST_NOTE_FOR_LINKLIST,
    FeedType.POST_NOTE_FOR_CHARACTER,
    FeedType.POST_NOTE_FOR_ERC721,
  ],
})
```

### Timeline: Get Feed of a Character's Following

In real-world social media, you can follow other users. In Crossbell, you can follow other characters with [`linkCharacter`](/sdk/js/contract/link/create-link#linkcharacter). (See [Guide - Link - Topics - Follow and Unfollow a Character](/sdk/js/guides/link#follow-and-unfollow-a-character).)

If a character `42` follows a group of characters, we can get the feed of the characters `42` follows:

```ts
const { list } = indexer.getFollowingFeedsOfCharacter(42)
```

This is commonly called the "home feed" or "timeline" in social media.
