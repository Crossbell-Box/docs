# Integration

If you already have a project and are considering integrating with Crossbell, we have some possible proposals:

- If your project has a social graph but it is currently centralized on servers, you could decentralize the social graph and benefit from the already existing social graph on Crossbell without modifying the users' experience.
- If you are building a content publishing service but your content is currently stored on central servers, you could move it to Crossbell to reduce your storage costs.
- If you are building a card or gift exchange service, you could move that exchange on-chain so that both the social graph and the assets could be crafted on-chain.
- ...

If you have any questions or ideas, you can schedule a call with us using [contact@crossbell.io](mailto:contact@crossbell.io). We will offer as much support as we can.
