# Character

A character is a distinct identity that enables interaction with the blockchain. In other words, it is the account that represents a user on the blockchain.

One user has one single crypto wallet. Each wallet (also referred to as an address) can contain multiple characters. Every character is associated with a single wallet.

You can learn more about characters in the [Concept - Character](/docs/concepts/character) section.

## Prepare the Contract and Indexer

Our futher steps will be using the `Contract` and `Indexer`. Please refer to the [API Reference](/sdk/js/api-reference) section to learn how to create them.

## Check if You Have a Character

You can check if you have a character by checking from the indexer:

```ts
const result = await indexer.character.getMany(address)
console.log(result.list) // character list
```

Because a wallet can have multiple characters, the result is a list of characters. If you don't have a character yet, the list will be empty.

## Create a Character

If you don't have a character yet, or you want to create a new one, you can use the [`contract.character.create`](https://crossbell-box.github.io/crossbell.js/classes/index.contracts.CharacterContract.html#create) method:

```ts
const result = await contract.character.create({
  owner,
  handle: 'best-character-ever',
  metadataOrUri: 'https://example.com/character-metadata.json',
})
console.log(result.data) // character id
```

The handle must be unique when creating a character. This is a unique identifier that will be displayed as `@best-character-ever` in the user interface. If a character with an existing handle is attempted to be created on the Crossbell blockchain, the transaction will be unsuccessful.

### Check if a Handle is Available

To ensure that the handle is available before creating a character, you can query from the indexer:

```ts
const result = await indexer.character.getByHandle('best-character-ever')
console.log(result.data) // a character or null
```

If the result is `null`, the handle is available.

### Character Metadata

The character metadata is a JSON object that contains the character's information.

In the example above, `"https://example.com/character-metadata.json"` is the URL of the character metadata. The character metadata can also be a JSON object:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "bio": "I am the best character ever"
}
```

You can add more metadata fields like `avatars`:

```json {4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "bio": "I am the best character ever",
  "avatars": ["https://example.com/avatar.png"]
}
```

It can be hosted on any web server. It can be `ipfs://` URL. For example, here is another more complex note metadata: [`ipfs://bafkreibu6cxouafklrbf5vvwnqdv2jtszru45gqdyswesyqlcdiffyy5la`](https://ipfs.4everland.xyz/ipfs/bafkreibu6cxouafklrbf5vvwnqdv2jtszru45gqdyswesyqlcdiffyy5la).

You can create a character with metadata content object directly:

```ts
const result = await contract.character.create({
  owner, // wallet address
  handle: 'best-character-ever', // handle
  metadataOrUri: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    bio: 'I am the best character ever',
  }, // character metadata
})
console.log(result.data) // character id
```

In this case, the SDK will automatically upload the metadata to IPFS and create a character with the `ipfs://` URL.

Please refer to the [Character Metadata](/docs/specs/metadata/character-metadata) section to learn more about the character metadata.

### Character Link Module

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout>
  Before attaching a link module to a character, please refer to the [Concepts - Mint/Link Module](/docs/concepts/link-mint-module) section to learn more about what a link module is.

Note that you won't be able to change the link module after the character is created.

## Update a Character

You can update a character using a variety of methods. For example:

- [Update handle](https://crossbell-box.github.io/crossbell.js/classes/index.contracts.CharacterContract.html#setHandle)
- [Update metadata](https://crossbell-box.github.io/crossbell.js/classes/index.contracts.CharacterContract.html#setMetadata)
- [Switch primary character](https://crossbell-box.github.io/crossbell.js/classes/index.contracts.CharacterContract.html#setPrimaryId)

## Delete a Character

- [Burn character](https://crossbell-box.github.io/crossbell.js/classes/index.contracts.CharacterContract.html#burn)

### Update Character Metadata

#### Example: Add an Avatar

Let's say we have a character `42` with the following metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "bio": "I am the best character ever"
}
```

If this character wants to add a new avatar, we can use the [`contract.character.changeMetadata`](https://crossbell-box.github.io/crossbell.js/classes/index.contracts.CharacterContract.html#changeMetadata) method:

```ts
contract.character.changeMetadata({
  characterId: 42,
  modifier: (metadata) => {
    metadata = {
      ...metadata,
      avatars: ['https://example.com/avatar.png'],
    }
    return metadata
  }
})
```

The `metadata` parameter is the current metadata of the character. You can modify it and return the new metadata. The SDK will automatically upload the new metadata to IPFS and update the character.

#### Example: Update the Attributes

As described in the [Character Metadata](/docs/specs/metadata/character-metadata#attributes) section, the character metadata can have an `attributes` field. This field is an array of attributes. Each attribute has a `trait_type` and a `value` field.

Let's say our character `42` has the following metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "bio": "I am the best character ever",
  "avatars": ["https://example.com/avatar.png"],
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Strength",
      "value": 100
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Agility",
      "value": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

We want to add a new attribute `Intelligence` with a value of `100`:

```ts
contract.character.changeMetadata({
  characterId: 42,
  modifier: (metadata) => {
    metadata = {
      ...metadata,
      attributes: [
        ...metadata.attributes, // copy the existing attributes
        {
          trait_type: 'Intelligence',
          value: 100,
        },
      ],
    }
    return metadata
  }
})
```

If we want to update the value of an existing attribute, we can use the [`Array.prototype.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) method:

```ts
contract.character.changeMetadata({
  characterId: 42,
  modifier: (metadata) => {
    metadata = {
      ...metadata,
      attributes: metadata.attributes.map(attribute => {
        if (attribute.trait_type === 'Intelligence') {
          return {
            ...attribute,
            value: 200,
          }
        }
        return attribute
      }),
    }
    return metadata
  }
})
```

#### Pitfall: Overwriting vs Merging

We are using the [`contract.character.changeMetadata`](https://crossbell-box.github.io/crossbell.js/classes/index.contracts.CharacterContract.html#changeMetadata) method to update the character metadata. This method helps us to update the metadata with **merging** instead of **overwriting**.

There is another method called [`contract.character.setCharacterMetadata`](https://crossbell-box.github.io/crossbell.js/classes/index.contracts.CharacterContract.html#setMetadata). This method will **overwrite** the metadata with the new metadata, which in most cases is NOT what we want because it will remove all the existing metadata of the character.
