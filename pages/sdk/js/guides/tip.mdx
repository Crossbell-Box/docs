# Tip

A character can tip (send) another character with the token $MIRA.

## $MIRA

$MIRA is a token that is used to tip other users. It is an ERC-20 token on the Crossbell Blockchain. For more information on $MIRA, please refer to the $MIRA Token page.

## Send Tips

### Tip a Character

For example, you are character `42` and you want to tip character `43` with `10` $MIRA.

First we need to get the token deciamls:

```ts
const decimals = await contract.getTokenDecimals() // 18 on Crossbell
```

> The token decimals is `18` on Crossbell blockchain. You can hardcode it if you want. But this step is recommended for the sake of future compatibility.

Then we need to calculate the amount of $MIRA to tip:

```ts
const amount = 10 * 10 ** decimals // 10 * 10^18
```

> You can also use the [`parseUnits`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/utils/#parseUnits) function from [`ethers`](https://ethers.org/) library to do this.
> For example, `ethers.utils.parseUnits('10', decimals)`.

Then we can tip the character:

```ts
await contract.tipCharacter(
  42, // from character
  43, // to character
  amount, // amount of $MIRA to tip
)
```

To bring it all together:

```ts
const decimals = await contract.getTokenDecimals()
const amount = 10 * 10 ** decimals
await contract.tipCharacter(42, 43, amount)
```

### Tip a Character For a Note

For example, you are character `42` and you want to tip character `43` with `10` $MIRA for the note `5` they wrote.

```ts
await contract.tipCharacterForNote(
  42, // from character
  43, // to character
  5, // note id
  amount, // amount of $MIRA to tip
)
```

This actaully does the same thing as `tipCharacter`. The tip will go to the character's wallet. The note ID here is just for the purpose of tracking to which the tip is for.

Please refer to the [Tip Contract API](/sdk/js/contract/tip/tip) page for more information.

## Query $MIRA Balance

### Query a Character's $MIRA Balance

For example, you want to query character `42`'s $MIRA balance.

```ts
const balance = await contract.getMiraBalanceOfCharacter(42)
```

The return value is a wei string, so you may want to convert it to the ether unit:

```ts
const decimals = await contract.getTokenDecimals()
const balanceInEther = balance / 10 ** decimals
```

To avoid the floating point precision issue, you can use the [`formatUnits`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/utils/#formatUnits) function from [`ethers`](https://ethers.org/) library:

```ts
import { formatUnits } from 'ethers'
const balanceInEther = formatUnits(balance, decimals)
```

To bring it all together:

```ts
import { formatUnits } from 'ethers'
const decimals = await contract.getTokenDecimals()
const balance = await contract.getMiraBalanceOfCharacter(42)
const balanceInEther = formatUnits(balance, decimals)
```

### Query an Address's $MIRA Balance

For example, you want to query address `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`'s $MIRA balance.

```ts
const balance = await contract.getMiraBalance(
  '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
)
```

The rest of it is the same as the example above.

Note that it is recommended to use `getMiraBalanceOfCharacter` in your app. Because if get the balance of an address and take it the balance of a character, it will not work as expected for newbie-village characters because they share the same address.

Please refer to the [Tip Contract API - Read Methods](/sdk/js/contract/tip/read-methods) page for more information.

## Query Tips

You can query tips from the indexer.

For example, to check the tip history (sending from) of character `42`:

```ts
const { list } = await indexer.getTips({
  characterId: 42,
})
```

To check the tip history (receiving to) of character `43`:

```ts
const { list } = await indexer.getTips({
  toCharacterId: 43,
})
```

To check the tip history (receiving to) of character `43` for the note `5`:

```ts
const { list } = await indexer.getTips({
  toCharacterId: 43,
  toNoteId: 5,
})
```

To check if character `42` has tipped character `43`:

```ts
const { list } = await indexer.getTips({
  characterId: 42,
  toCharacterId: 43,
})
```
