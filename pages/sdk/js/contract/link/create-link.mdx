# Create Link

A "link" is a component that links two things on Crossbell together. It can be a link between two characters, a character or a note, etc.

All links start from a character.

## `linkCharacter`

This links a character to another character.

```ts
linkCharacter(fromCharacterId: BigNumberish, toCharacterId: BigNumberish, linkType: string, data?: string, overrides?: Overrides): Promise<Result<number, true>>
```

### Usage

Character ID `42` follows Character ID `10`:

```ts
crossbell.linkCharacter(42, 10, "follow")
```

### Parameters

#### `fromCharacterId`

- Type: BigNumberish

The ID of the character that is doing the linking.

#### `toCharacterId`

- Type: BigNumberish

The ID of the character that is being linked to.

#### `linkType`

- Type: string

The type of link. This can be any string, but it is recommended to use a short, descriptive string.

#### `data`

- Type: string

The data to be passed to the link module if the character has one.

### Returns

```ts
interface Returns {
  /* The ID of the linklist. */
  data: number
  transactionHash: string
}
```

## `createThenLinkCharacter`

This creates a character for an target address and links the fromCharacter to it.

This should be only called when the target address doesn't have any character. When called on an address that already has a character, this will fail.

When called, this will create a new character for the target address and set the new character as the primary character for this address.

The new character's handle will be set to the address of the target address.

```ts
createThenLinkCharacter(fromCharacterId: BigNumberish, toAddress: string, linkType: string, overrides?: Overrides): Promise<Result<{ linklistId: number; toCharacterId: number; }, true>>
```

### Usage

Character ID `42` follows Address `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890` who *doesn't* have a character:

```ts
crossbell.createThenLinkCharacter(42, "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", "follow")
```

### Parameters

#### `fromCharacterId`

- Type: BigNumberish

The ID of the character that is doing the linking.

#### `toAddress`

- Type: string

The address to create a character for and then link to. This address must not have a character.

#### `linkType`

- Type: string

The type of link. This can be any string, but it is recommended to use a short, descriptive string.

### Returns

```ts
interface Returns {
  /* The ID of the linklist. */
  data: {
    linklistId: number
    toCharacterId: number
  }
  transactionHash: string
}
```

## `linkCharactersInBatch`

This links a character to multiple characters with a given link type in batch.

This could be considered a bulk version of [linkCharacter](#linkcharacter) and [createThenLinkCharacter](#createthenlinkcharacter).

```ts
linkCharactersInBatch(fromCharacterId: BigNumberish, toCharacterIds: BigNumberish[], toAddresses: string[], linkType: string, data?: string[], overrides?: Overrides): Promise<Result<number, true>>
```

### Usage

Character ID `42` follows Character ID `10` and Address `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890` who *doesn't* have a character:

```ts
crossbell.linkCharactersInBatch(42, [10], ["0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"], "follow")
