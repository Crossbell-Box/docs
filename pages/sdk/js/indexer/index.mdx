# Initialize Indexer

To query the blockchain, you need to use the `indexer`. The indexer is a server that connects to the blockchain and indexes the data into a database for querying faster and easier.

```ts
import { Indexer } from "crossbell.js";
```

## Usage

```ts {3}
import { Indexer } from 'crossbell.js'

const indexer = new Indexer()
```

## Methods

There are many methods on the `indexer` class. For example:

```ts
// get the characters owned by an address
const result = await indexer.getCharacters('0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890')
console.log(result.list)
```

The doc is still under construction, but you can find the full list of API [here](https://indexer.crossbell.io/docs/).
