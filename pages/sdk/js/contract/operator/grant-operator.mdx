# Grant Operator

A user can grant operator (another address) to a character or a note. This allows the operator to perform certain actions on the character or note.

## `grantOperatorPermissionsForCharacter`

This grants permissions to an operator for a character.

Each character can have multiple operators. An operator can be any address. It can then be used to operate transactions in behalf of the character's owner.

Each time an operator is granted permissions, its previous permissions are overwritten.

### Usage

For example, the character `42` can be granted permissions to `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890` to `LINK_NOTE`, `UNLINK_NOTE` and `POST_NOTE`:

```ts
contract.grantOperatorPermissionsForCharacter(
  42, // characterId
  '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', // operator
  ['LINK_NOTE', 'UNLINK_NOTE', 'POST_NOTE'] // permissions
)
```

Now the operator can perform the following actions on behalf of the character:

- [`linkNote`](/sdk/js/contract/link/create-link#linknote)
- [`unlinkNote`](/sdk/js/contract/link/remove-link#unlinknote)
- [`postNote`](/sdk/js/contract/note/create-note#postnote)

### Parameters

#### `characterId`

- Type: BigNumberish

The ID of the character who wants to grant permissions to an operator.

#### `operator`

- Type: string

The address of the operator.

#### `permissions`

- Type: string[]

The permissions to grant to the operator.

You can see the list of permissions in the [Specs - Permissions](/docs/specs/operator/permissions#permission-bitmap-layout) section.

To completely remove an operator, pass an empty array (`[]`) to the `permissions` parameter.

### Returns

```ts
interface Returns {
  transactionHash: string
}
```

## `grantOperatorsForNote`

This grants permission to an operator for a note.

Each note can have multiple operators. An operator can be any address. It can then be used to operate transactions in behalf of the note's owner.

Each time an operator is granted permissions, its previous permissions are overwritten.

### Usage

```ts
contract.grantOperatorsForNote(
  42, // characterId
  5, // noteId
  ['0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890'], // allowlist
  [] // blocklist
)
```

Now the operator can perform the following actions on behalf of the note:

- [`setNoteUri`]((/sdk/js/contract/note/update-note#setnoteuri))

### Parameters

#### `characterId`

- Type: BigNumberish

The ID of the character who owns the note.

#### `noteId`

- Type: BigNumberish

The ID of the note.

#### `allowlist`

- Type: string[]

The list of addresses that are allowed to operate on the note.

#### `blocklist`

- Type: string[]

The list of addresses that are not allowed to operate on the note. This list takes precedence over the allowlist.

### Returns

```ts
interface Returns {
  transactionHash: string
}
```
