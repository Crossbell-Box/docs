# Character

A character is a distinct identity that enables interaction with the blockchain. In other words, it is the account that represents a user on the blockchain.

One user has one single crypto wallet. Each wallet (also referred to as an address) can contain multiple characters. Every character is associated with a single wallet.

You can learn more about characters in the [Concept - Character](/docs/concepts/character) section.

## Prepare the Contract and Indexer

Our futher steps will be using the `Contract` and `Indexer`. Please refer to the [Contract](/sdk/js/contract) and [Indexer](/sdk/js/indexer) section to learn how to create them.

## Check if You Have a Character

You can check if you have a character by checking from the indexer:

```ts
const result = await indexer.getCharacters(address)
console.log(result.list) // character list
```

Because a wallet can have multiple characters, the result is a list of characters. If you don't have a character yet, the list will be empty.

## Create a Character

If you don't have a character yet, or you want to create a new one, you can use the [`contract.createCharacter`](/sdk/js/contract/character/create-character#createcharacter) method:

```ts
const result = await contract.createCharacter(
  address, // wallet address
  'best-character-ever', // handle
  "https://example.com/character-metadata.json", // character metadata
)
console.log(result.data) // character id
```

The [`handle`](/sdk/js/contract/character/create-character#handle) must be unique when creating a character. This is a unique identifier that will be displayed as `@best-character-ever` in the user interface. If a character with an existing handle is attempted to be created on the Crossbell blockchain, the transaction will be unsuccessful.

### Check if a Handle is Available

To ensure that the handle is available before creating a character, you can query from the indexer:

```ts
const result = await indexer.getCharactersByHandle('best-character-ever')
console.log(result.data) // a character or null
```

If the result is `null`, the handle is available.

### Character Metadata

The character metadata is a JSON object that contains the character's information.

In the example above, `"https://example.com/character-metadata.json"` is the URL of the character metadata. The character metadata can also be a JSON object:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "bio": "I am the best character ever"
}
```

You can add more metadata fields like `avatars`:

```json {4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "bio": "I am the best character ever",
  "avatars": ["https://example.com/avatar.png"]
}
```

It can be hosted on any web server. It can be `ipfs://` URL. For example, here is another more complex note metadata: [`ipfs://bafkreibu6cxouafklrbf5vvwnqdv2jtszru45gqdyswesyqlcdiffyy5la`](https://ipfs.4everland.xyz/ipfs/bafkreibu6cxouafklrbf5vvwnqdv2jtszru45gqdyswesyqlcdiffyy5la).

You can create a character with metadata content object directly:

```ts
const result = await contract.createCharacter(
  address, // wallet address
  'best-character-ever', // handle
  {
    name: 'John Doe',
    bio: 'I am the best character ever',
  }, // character metadata
)
console.log(result.data) // character id
```

In this case, the SDK will automatically upload the metadata to IPFS and create a character with the `ipfs://` URL.

Please refer to the [Character Metadata](/docs/specs/metadata/character-metadata) section to learn more about the character metadata.

### Character Link Module

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout>
  Before attaching a link module to a character, please refer to the [Concepts - Mint/Link Module](/docs/concepts/link-mint-module) section to learn more about what a link module is.
</Callout>

// TODO @songkeys

Note that you won't be able to change the link module after the character is created.

Please refer to the [`linkModule` options API](/sdk/js/contract/character/create-character#optionslinkmodule) for more details.

## Update a Character

You can update a character using a variety of methods. For example:

- [Update handle](/sdk/js/contract/character/update-handle)
- [Update metadata](/sdk/js/contract/character/update-metadata)
- [Switch primary character](/sdk/js/contract/character/switch-primary-character)

## Delete a Character

- [Burn character](/sdk/js/contract/character/burn-character)
