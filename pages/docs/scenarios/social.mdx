## Social Interactions

Let’s start from a basic scenario, a developer is aimed at to build an app upon Crossbell, which lets each user post note, follow others, and see others’ feeds. What should he/she do?

### Authentication

All starts from authentication. The typical authentication way for a Web3 app is to use the wallet identity and instruct wallet users to mint his or her own characters. But to help bridge more Web2 users, Crossbell also provides the email login method.

Crossbell will create the characters and hosting for email users. They can upgrade to wallet users at any time by preparing a wallet and being ready to do so.

In summary, Crossbell provides a "connect button" component(as image above shows) that wraps the two login methods. This component covers all Crossbell authentication logic, including guides to mint characters or register an email account. 

This means developers can easily handle complicated identities without setting up a database or considering the underlying Crossbell identity logic. You can find more information about the "connect button" component in this [documentation page](https://crossbell-dev.vercel.app/docs/connect-button).
