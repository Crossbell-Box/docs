# Lock Note

A note can be locked by the owner to prevent it from being edited.

When a note is locked, it can't be edited and unlocked anymore. I.e., you can't change the content of the note using `setNoteUri`, `setNoteMetadata`, `changeNoteMetadata`. You can still delete the note using `deleteNote`.

This is useful when, for example, the note is expected to be read-only as an evidence.

## `lockNote`

Locks a note.

```ts
lockNote(characterId: BigNumberish, noteId: BigNumberish, overrides?: Overrides): Promise<Result<undefined, true>>
```

### Usage

```ts
contract.lockNote(
  42, // characterId
  5, // noteId
)
```

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="warning">
  When a note is locked, it can't be edited and unlocked anymore.
</Callout>

### Parameters

#### `characterId`

- Type: BigNumberish

The ID of the character.

#### `noteId`

The ID of the note.
