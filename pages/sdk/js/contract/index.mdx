# Create Contract

To interact with the blockchain, you need to use the `contract`. A contract is a collection of functions that can be called by other contracts or by users directly through wallets. The contract is the main building block of the blockchain.

```ts
import { Contract } from "crossbell.js";
```

## Usage

### Example 1: Connect with Metamask (Or Other Provider)

```ts {3-5}
import { Contract } from 'crossbell.js'

// Create a new contract instance with metamask provider
const provider = window.ethereum
const contract = new Contract(provider)

await contract.connect() // Connect to the chain
```

You can also use other providers.

### Example 2: Connect with Private Key

```ts {3-4}
import { Contract } from 'crossbell.js'

const privateKey = '0xabcdef0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234'
const contract = new Contract(privateKey)

await contract.connect() // Connect to the chain
```

The private key is not stored in the contract. It is only used to sign the transaction.

However, you need to ensure that your private key is not exposed to the public for security reasons.

### Example 3: Read-Only Contract

You can also connect with a read-only provider without passing anything into the `Contract`.

```ts {3}
import { Contract } from 'crossbell.js'

const contract = new Contract();

await contract.connect() // Connect to the chain
```

In this case, you can't do write operations like `createCharacter` but only read operations like `getCharacter`.

  You need to call `await contract.connect()` before using the contract.
