# Update Handle

When you have your character and get bored with the handle, you can change it.

## `setHandle`

This changes a character's handle.

```ts
setHandle(characterId: BigNumberish, handle: string, overrides?: Overrides): Promise<Result<undefined, true>>
```

### Usage

```ts
contract.setHandle(10, 'my-new-handle')
```

### Parameters

#### `characterId`

- Type: BigNumberish

The ID of the character to change the handle of.

#### `handle`

- Type: string

The handle to change to.

It must be unique among all characters.

It follows this regular expression: `^[a-z0-9\-\_]{3,32}$`, which means it can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, and must be between 3 and 32 characters long.

### Returns

```ts
interface Returns {
  transactionHash: string
}
```
