# Mint Note

A note can be minted by wallets (i.e. addresses).

A minted note is a non-fungible token (NFT) that is stored on the Crossbell blockchain. The wallet that minted the note is the owner of the NFT.

## `mintNote`

Mints a note.

```ts
mintNote(characterId: BigNumberish, noteId: BigNumberish, toAddress: string, overrides?: Overrides): Promise<Result<{ contractAddress: string; tokenId: number; }, true>>
```

### Usage

For example, to mint a note with characterId `42` and noteId `5` to the address `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`:

```ts
const { data } = await contract.mintNote(
  42, // characterId
  5, // noteId
  '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', // toAddress
)
console.log(data.contractAddress) // e.g. 0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1
console.log(data.tokenId) // e.g. 6
```

Now, the address `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890` owns the note NFT with contract address `0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1` and token ID `6` (meaning that the note NFT is stored at the contract of address `0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc1`, and the minter is the 6th to mint).

### Parameters

- Type: BigNumberish

#### `noteId`

#### `toAddress`

### Returns

  data: {
    contractAddress: string
    tokenId: number
  }
  transactionHash: string
}
```
